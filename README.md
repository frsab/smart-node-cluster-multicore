This module will provide examples of nodeJS instance scheduling algorithms on a multicore machine and a cluster of multiple machines to better exploit the CPU and GPU resources of your production servers.
The algorithms implemented in priority will come from a paper research and scientific article cetified IEEE
it will offer several generic templates to implement your own algorithms and implement the strategy that suits you.
